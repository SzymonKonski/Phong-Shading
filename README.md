# Phong-Shading
Application filling polygons with **scanline algorithm including Phong lightning model**.


## Algorithm
Filling polygons is programmed using scanline algorithm with vertices sorting and Active Edges Table (CPU implementation). Self-implemented Phong lightning model is used. 

## Functionalities and user guide

You can adjust algorithm parameters using menu on the right panel. 
What is more, you can move triangles' vertices using mouse.
